# Alarm-clock
The concept of for loops and nested for loops are basic logical 
backbone for this program, and the time library has been used to retrieve the systemâ€™s current 
tine, thus excluding the need to ask the user to enter the current time. This makes the alarm clock 
more seamless and also eliminates any possible errors that might occur while entering the time.
