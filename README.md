 This alarm is developed in C 
language. A clock will appear, displaying the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The 
user should be able to select three fields using the time picker: hour, minutes, and seconds. To set 
the value, each field will have one up and one down button. The hour field can be set to 0 â€“ 23, 
the minutes field to 0-59, and the seconds field to 0-59. This has been achieved by the 
combination of conditional statement and logical operators. In case of overflow, the next field 
will be automatically incremented. The timer will go from current system time in the beginning 
to the alarm time provided by the user. Then, once the timer reaches the set time, the alarm will 
ring at the specified time after running the program. The sound is the result of including the 
windows header file which contains the beep and sleep functions. This library is full of functions 
that help us gain access to the system software as well as hardware, but it can only work on 
offline compilers on windows systems.
